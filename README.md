PubSubHubbub
============

PubSubHubbub is an open protocol for distributed publish/subscribe communication on the Internet. It generalizes the concept of webhooks
and allows data produces and data consumers to work in a decoupled way.

PubSubHubbub provides a way to subscribe, unsubscribe and receive updates from a resource, whether it's an RSS or Atom feed or any web accessible document (JSON...).

Open hubs are provided by:
* [Superfeedr](http://pubsubhubbub.superfeedr.com/)
* [Google](http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/)

Several other publishing platforms, like Wordpress, include their own hub.

Learn more about the project at [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/) (some info might be out of date) or use the [test suite to test compliance](http://tests.superfeedr.com/) for an existing hub.
